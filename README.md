# ORTIZ-Data-Science-Portfolio

## üîç About 

This repository is a centralized place to showcase all of my classwork and notable data science projects, which will highlight my experiences and technical skills!  
- It contains the following basic folders: `Datasets`, `Visualizations`, `EDA`, and `Models`.
- Additionally, it contains in-class Jupyter notebooks which are organized by week number and subject! (Ex. *"(Week 05)-Missing-Data"*)
- Finally *(and most importantly)*, it houses various projects I've worked on such as **`Basic-Streamlit-App`**, **`TidyData-Project`**, **`MLStreamlitApp`**, and most recently, **`MLUnsupervisedApp`**!

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### üë©‚Äçüíª [Basic Streamlit App](https://github.com/verortiz06/ORTIZ-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)
- **Description:** This project focuses on creating an app on Streamlit which reads data and includes interactive widgets
- **Key Skills Displayed:** Python, Streamlit framework, data storytelling, and interactive presentation
- **Application**: This project showcases technical proficiency with Python and ability to present data in a **readable and engaging way** for non-technical users
### üìä [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/verortiz06/ORTIZ-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)
- **Description:** This project focuses on cleaning and restructuring messy data into a **tidy format**, making it more accessible for analysis and visualization
- **Key Skills Displayed:** Data cleaning, Tidy Data principles, visualization, and aggregation techniques
- **Application:** This project showcases my ability to handle **real-world, messy datasets**, transforming them into usable formats for **machine learning and statistical analysis**
### üõ†Ô∏è [Supervised Machine Learning App](https://github.com/verortiz06/ORTIZ-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)
- **Description:** This project focuses on creating an interactive Streamlit app that allows users to explore core concepts of maching learning through experimentation with features, hyperparameters, and Train-Test ratios
- **Key Skills**: Python proficiency, Machine Learning knowledge, model deployment, data handling, data visualization, web app development
- **Application**: This project showcases my proficiency in Python through a complex, user-friendly, and complete Streamlit App that displays a solid understanding of serveral Machine Learning models and their core concepts
### ‚öôÔ∏è [Unsupervised Machine Learning App](https://github.com/verortiz06/ORTIZ-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp)
- **Description:** This project focuses on developing an interactive and easily understandable Streamlit app that teaches and allows users to explore and learn about unsupervised machine learning models. Users can upload their own data or use built-in datasets, select features, apply K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, or PCA, adjust parameters, and visualize the results with accompanying explanations
- **Key Skills**: Python mastery, advanced unsupervised machine learning understanding, data handling and preprocessing, data visualization, and an emphasis on code structure and readability 
- **Application**: This project highlights my mastery of Python through a solid understanding of how various unsupervised machine learning models can be utilized for analysis and prediction. Not only do the skills used in this final project encompass all of the techniques I have had to use for the previous three projects, they are essential knowledge for any data scientist who needs to explore data, apply machine learning techniques, build interactive tools to communicate findings to non-experts, and deploy data-driven applications
