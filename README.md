# ORTIZ-Data-Science-Portfolio

## üîç About 

This repository is a centralized place to showcase all of my classwork and notable data science projects, which will highlight my experiences and technical skills!  
- It contains the following basic folders: `Datasets`, `Visualizations`, `EDA`, and `Models`.
- Additionally, it contains in-class Jupyter notebooks which are organized by week number and subject! (Ex. *"(Week 5)-Missing-Data"*)
- Finally *(and most importantly)*, it houses various projects I've worked on such as **`Basic-Streamlit-App`**, **`TidyData-Project`**, and **`MLStreamlitApp`**
