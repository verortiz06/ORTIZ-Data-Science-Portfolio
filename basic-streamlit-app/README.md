# Basic Streamlit App: Palmer's Penguins Explorer
## 📌 Project Overview 
This project is focused on creating a simple streamlit app which reads data and has interactive widgets! The app provides a user-friendly interface to view information about 343 penguins, including their species, island, sex, bill dimensions, flipper length, and body mass. In this app, users can:
- See an overview of the Palmer's Penguins dataset content
- Filter the dataset to display penguins of a specific species, a particular island, or based on a minimum flipper length using a slider
- View the filtered data presented in a table format

## ⚙️ How to Run This Project
### 1️⃣ Ensure that you have Streamlit and Pandas installed
If not, you can install them using: 
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas
```
### 2️⃣ Within your terminal:
Locate the correct location of the basic-streamlit-app file by using commands **"ls"** to explore your desktop and **"cd"** to "double-click" into your folders until you find *basic-streamlit-app/main.py*
### 3️⃣ Still within your terminal: 
- Type out "streamlit run basic-streamlit-app/main.py"
This will automatically take you to a local url in which you can begin to use and play with the app!

## 🛠️ Key Filters
- Filter by **species** using a selectbox
- Filter by **island** using a selectbox
- Filter by **flipper Length (mm)** using a slider (shows penguins less than or equal to the selected value)
